# Shortcuts for Photos

This directory is dedicated specifically to shortcuts that primarily work with the [Photos](url) app, its library, and the media within it.

### *Photos* vs *Files*

Put simply, an image file in your iCloud Drive is not the same as one in your Photo library- even if they're literally the same image. I know that might sound a little confusing, so I'll explain...

The reason the two aforementioned "identical" images are not *actually* the same is because they're imaginary and don't really exist.

Oh and it's also because the __Photo Library__ (aka *iCloud Photos*) is a separate entity from your device's actual *file system* (e.g. your *iCloud Drive*), most of the functionality available for __Photos__ isn't compatible with __Files__, and same vice versa.

accessed & managed using the [Files](url) (iOS/iPadOS) and [Finder](url) (MacOS) apps.
