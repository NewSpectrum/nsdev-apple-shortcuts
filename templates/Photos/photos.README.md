# Shortcuts for Photos

> __Note__<br />
> This directory is dedicated specifically to shortcuts that primarily work with the [Photos](url) app, its library, and the media in said library.
> 
> There will be very little (if any) integration with the actual file system, which is a separate entity accessed & managed using the [Files](url) (iOS/iPadOS) and [Finder](url) (MacOS) apps.
